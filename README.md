# Audio Frequency Comparison and Voice Similarity Evaluation


# 📌 Project Description

This project analyzes and compares two audio recordings to measure how similar they are based on their frequency-domain features. The audio signals are converted from time domain to frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). A combined frequency graph is generated and a similarity score is calculated using cosine similarity.

# 🎯 Objectives

Load and process two audio files

Convert audio signals into frequency domain

Plot frequency comparison graph

Calculate numerical similarity score

# 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used

Python

Librosa

NumPy

Matplotlib

SciPy


# 📂 Project Files

main.py – Python code for analysis

audio1.mp3 – First audio file

audio2.mp3 – Second audio file

frequency_comparison.png – Output graph (optional)


# ▶ How to Run the Project

Install required libraries:

pip install librosa numpy matplotlib scipy


# Run the program:

python main.py


# 📊 Output

A frequency-domain comparison graph of both audio files

A similarity score indicating how closely the two audios match

# ✅ Conclusion

The project successfully compares two audio signals using frequency-domain analysis and provides a visual and numerical method to measure audio similarity.
